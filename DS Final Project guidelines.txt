Project points:
1)Have to present a single system image
2)Don't have to build an entire service, just a simulation of sorts. Can be on GUI or console
3)Must have some degree of replication(wasn't elaborated on really). Not a priority though
4)Must be able to open, close, read, edit, and write files. Sir suggested that for edit, try appending only first
5)Should be a check for whether the file is a text file, since opening with notepad or equivalent.
6)APIs we use in the project do not have to be visible to Sir
7)System has to be across minimum 3 machines
8)Can implement upload/download or remote access model
9)Have to have our own algorithm to make decision on where a new file is to be created
10)Algorithm can be based on storage, or we can make up cost values and do cost based too
11)Can have a sub folder, called DOS Project or whatever, so that local files do not interfere with our service etc.
12)Must check that file doesn't already exist on creation
13)OPTIONAL: Local file creation resolves conflicts across our system as well.
